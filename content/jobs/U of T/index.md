- Designed a privacy-preserving deep learning framework combining split learning and federated learning to predict ICU mortality from distributed vital signs data, outperforming centralized models.
- Achieved AUC ROC of 0.98 in detecting distracted driving behaviors using 3D CNNs and supervised contrastive learning on multiview depth and infrared video.
- Developed RNNs and temporal convolutional networks to analyze long multivariate time-series data from wearable sensors for accurate step counting.
