- Designed and deployed an ML-driven multimodal sensor platform for remote patient monitoring using smartphones, smartwatches, and sleep sensors. Built feature engineering pipelines and machine learning models on Google Cloud Platform, deployed across multiple hospitals. The models analyzed time-series sensor data to detect social isolation and functional decline, and to predict responsive behaviors.
- Built a web-based rehabilitation platform with an interactive avatar, connected to device cameras for in-home patient care. Applied deep learning and LLMs with prompt engineering on Azure to assess exercise quality from video-based body joint data, enabling real-time feedback. Models supported regression and binary classification for evaluating movement quality and used natural language generation to deliver feedback.
- Developed a hybrid LLM and vision transformer framework with prompt engineering for disease classification and localization in chest X-ray images, improving diagnostic accuracy and interpretability.
- Developed a deep learning framework to analyze facial video data for assessing the affective states of drivers with mild cognitive impairment during autonomous vehicle takeover requests. The system evaluated emotional responses to support safety and behavioral insights.
